# 2D Sidescroller
Small 2d-side scroller built in unity with tiling, stored high scores, point system, enemies, and collectables.

## What it does
Playing as a 2d character, the user has to get to the end without being killed from the enemy or fall into a hole all before the time runs out. The faster the player gets to the end and the more collectables they attain the higher their score. The more asteroids a player collects before running out of lives, the higher they score!

## How I built it
This project was built in Unity with C# and incorporated some quick and easy MS paint sprites. Through experimentation I added game features similar to the ones that are available in super mario. The level is relatively short however all the basic components and prefabs are integrated such that expanding the level will only recquire some creativity and game design. We combined our knowledge and C# code to create a working prototype of the game.
